Miscellaneous remote.it Embedded Bins and Scripts

### Misc Scripts
Some scripts to help embed remote.it into your system.

### Startup Scripts
Various starup script examples for Linux systems.


### Misc Bins
These are precompiled bins for various platforms not included in the standard installer.  Most are staticly linked binaries to be compatible with the widest range of systems.  They should not be considered up to date or optimized in any way for any particular platform.  One of these should however run on your embedded linux platform.  There may be duplicates or multiple compatible binaires here.

If none of these run, let remote.it know and we will help you build it for your platform.

See connectd directory for details
